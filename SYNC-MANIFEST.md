# Vibe Prompt Architect — Sync Manifest

This file governs the relationship between `SKILL.md` (Claude Skill) and
`vibe-prompt-architect-gem.md` (Gemini Gem). Open it at the start of every editing
session. Use the Feature Touch Map to identify every location a change must affect.
Run the Pre-Commit Checklist before closing any session.

**Session protocol:** Always upload all three files — `SKILL.md`,
`vibe-prompt-architect-gem.md`, and `SYNC-MANIFEST.md` — when requesting changes in
Claude. The manifest must be in context for Claude to apply it.

## Section 1 — File Anatomy Map

Annotation key:
- `PARALLEL` — Must be identical in substance. Wording may differ by format; meaning must not.
- `EQUIVALENT` — Same content at different detail levels. SKILL.md is more detailed; Gem is more concise.
- `FILE-SPECIFIC` — Intentionally present in only one file. Do not "fix" by adding to the other.
- `DERIVED` — Content generated from another section. Changes to the source section must propagate here.
- `TEMPLATE` — Part of the generated prompt output. Changes here affect what users copy-paste.

## Section 2 — Feature Touch Map

When adding or changing any feature, every checked location below must be updated in
**both files** unless marked `(SKILL.md only)` or `(Gem only)`.

### Adding or changing a question (Q-number)

Questions may be **top-level** (Q1, Q2, … Q15) or **conditional follow-ups** that fire only when a specific upstream answer is given. Conditional follow-ups use letter-suffixed numbering (e.g., Q5a for primary CTA after Q5; Q1a/Q1b/Q1c for Claude Code + Figma MCP follow-ups after Q1). When adding either kind, run the touchpoints below.

## Section 3 — Pre-Commit Checklist

Run this before closing any editing session. Answer every question. If the answer to any
question is "no" or "not sure", do not close the session — resolve the gap first.

## Section 4 — Intentional Differences

The following differences between the files are correct and must not be "fixed."

| What differs | SKILL.md | Gem | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory Consultation | Absent | Present | Claude handles cross-session memory natively; Gemini requires explicit instructions |
| Version history table | Absent | Present | Gem is a versioned document edited by humans; SKILL.md is managed at file-system level. As of v2.16.0, SKILL.md carries a single-line version marker (YAML comment + italic byline under H1) so the current version is visible at a glance and copies of the file found outside version control can be dated, but the full history table remains Gem-only. |
| Human editors note | Two-line YAML comment | Blockquote after version table | Different appropriate locations in each file format |
| Role / persona description | YAML front matter description | `## Role` section with explicit persona statement | Claude Skill format vs Gem instruction format |
| Recalled / new annotations | Absent | Present in Phase 1 closing summary | Applies only when Memory Consultation is active |
| TC-EBC framework detail | Fuller — sub-bullets, examples, do/don't | Concise — one-liners per section | SKILL.md is Claude's working reference; Gem provides essentials |
| Phase 1 section heading depth | `###` | `####` (nested under `### Phase 1 — Gather`) | Different document structures |
| Phase 2 flag heading style | `### Flag Name` | `**Flag Name**` bold paragraph | Different document structures |
| Principles heading | `## Key Principles (always in effect)` | `## Principles` | Historical naming; substance is identical |
| Post-generation format | Bullet list | Bold-header paragraphs | Both cover the same topics; format differs |
| DESIGN.md Gem note | Absent | `stitch.withgoogle.com` + lint CLI reference | Gem users are more likely to be Stitch users generating DESIGN.md files |

## Section 5 — Sync Health Log

Record any known drift or deferred fixes here. Clear entries when resolved.

| Date | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-03 | Initial manifest created after 15-finding quality check. Both files are fully synced as of SKILL.md (no version) and Gem v2.10.0. | ✅ Resolved — both files clean at manifest creation |
| 2026-05-08 | Authority File Gate introduced (v2.12.0). Q7/Q8/Q8b moved before Q9. Q9 now conditional on authority file status. Raw Value Translation gains authority file gate. New "Authority file gates primitive intake" principle added. "Translate, don't discard" updated. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2026-05-08 | Platform-implied authority file (v2.13.0). Q8 and Q8b removed as explicit questions; Figma Make (Q1) automatically establishes Make Kit authority, Google Stitch (Q1) establishes DESIGN.md authority. Readiness warning added to Phase 1 after Q1 and to Make Kit / Design Guidelines output template sections. Phase 2 flags, Principles, and Memory Consultation (Gem) updated. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2026-05-19 | Output delivery format (v2.14.0). "File Creation Rule" renamed to "Output Delivery Rule" in both files and expanded to require raw Markdown delivered in-line in chat (wrapped in a fenced code block), never as a file/canvas/doc/Drive artifact or rendered preview. Output Format section gains explicit delivery instruction. New "Output is raw Markdown, in-line in the chat" principle added to both Principles lists. Gem Role line updated. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2026-05-19 | Claude Code + Figma MCP scenario (v2.15.0). Third platform-implied authority alongside Figma Make and Google Stitch — Component Library (Q1b) and Variables (Q1c) act as granular dual authority (each independently active). New Q1 readiness notice plus Q1a/Q1b/Q1c follow-up questions, Authority File Gate expanded from 4 to 6 status-table rows and from 4 to 7 preamble variants (Make Kit / DESIGN.md / Figma Component Library + Variables both / only Library / only Variables / named system / none), Raw Value Translation gate redirects to `{group/variable-name}` form (initially documented as `{Collection}/{Group}/{variable-name}`; corrected to literal Figma form in v2.16.1), new Phase 2 Figma MCP Flag, new conditional output template section with `use_figma` instruction, new "Figma MCP routes to Figma Design" principle, Memory Consultation table extended. Sync Manifest gains new "Adding or changing the Claude Code + Figma MCP scenario" sub-section. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2026-05-19 | Human-readable version marker added to SKILL.md (v2.16.0). YAML front-matter comment plus italic byline directly under the H1 surface the current version, date, and Gem-parity reference visibly without polluting the Skills schema. Lets "vintage" SKILL.md copies found outside version control be dated at a glance. Sync Manifest: new "Version marker (single-line)" row in Section 1 Anatomy Map, Section 4 Intentional Differences updated to clarify the marker / full-table split, new "Bumping the version" Feature Touch Map sub-section in Section 2, Pre-Commit Checklist item 7 expanded to require all three locations (Gem table, SKILL.md YAML comment, SKILL.md byline) move in lockstep. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced at v2.16.0. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2026-05-19 | Quality-audit cleanup patch (v2.16.1). Resolved 6 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, and 4 LOW findings from a cross-file audit of v2.14–v2.16. Most impactful changes: (1) Figma Variable reference syntax corrected from invented `{Collection}/{Group}/{variable-name}` to literal Figma `{group/variable-name}` with Collection as separate metadata; (2) Phase 2 "dependency chain" principle updated to name Figma MCP in the flag order in both files; (3) output template AC block + Phase 2 AC Flags gain Figma-MCP-conditional mandatory items (target file, library binding, Variable binding, modes, naming, auto-layout); (4) Phase 1 closing summary "Authority file status" line rewritten to enumerate active states atomically rather than introducing a third compound name; (5) Authority Gate "None" row scope clarified for Claude Code + Figma MCP with empty Q1b/Q1c/Q7; (6) "Translate don't discard" principle and Post-Generation Authority tip extended to Figma Variables; (7) SYNC-MANIFEST Section 1 row + Authority Gate touchpoint + "Adding or changing a question" sub-section all updated; (8) cosmetic — Q1a/b/c rendered as nested list items; blank lines added before Authority File Gate heading. SKILL.md and Gem fully synced at v2.16.1. | ✅ Resolved |
